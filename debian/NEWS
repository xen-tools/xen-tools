xen-tools (4.4~beta1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exported environment variables no more contain dashes ("-"). Dashes in
    environment variable names are from now on converted to underscores
    ("_") before being exported. May affect some hook or role scripts.

  * /usr/lib/xen-tools/ has been moved to /usr/share/xen-tools/ to
    properly adhere to FHS. In case you had local scripts added to
    /usr/lib/xen-tools/, please move them to /usr/share/xen-tools/, too
    and then remove /usr/lib/xen-tools/ and its left-over subdirectories
    which all should be empty at that point, i.e. "rmdir -p
    /usr/lib/xen-tools/*" should do the trick.

xen-tools (4.2~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  By default, xen-create-image now generates a random root password and
  displays it as plain text at the end of the DomU generation process.
  Use --genpass=0 and --passwd=1 to interactively set a root password
  without the password being displayed.

xen-tools (4.2~beta1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  If the DomU hangs with "Waiting for root file system" despite
  /dev/xvd* is used as disk device, adding "xen-blkfront" to
  /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and runing "update-initramfs -u"
  afterwards may help.

  If the Dom0 is a Debian or Ubuntu, the distribution and suite for
  DomUs defaults to the distribution and suite the Dom0 is
  running. Otherwise Debian DomUs get "stable" and Ubuntu "lucid" by
  default.

  Default Debian/Ubuntu mirror is now determined by looking into
  /etc/apt/sources.list (if it exists) and taking the first entry with
  path ending in /debian/ there.
