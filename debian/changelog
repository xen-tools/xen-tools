  [Axel Beckert]

      STDOUT. (Closes: #513126)
    - Adds btrfs support.

  * Reintroduction into Debian Unstable (Closes: #566714)
  * New upstream beta version
    - Needs dependency on libfile-slurp-perl
    - Supports for more recent versions of Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian
      (Closes: #499477)
    - Supports pygrub. (Added "Suggests: xen-utils" to debian/control)
    - Uses hvc0 and xvda devices by default
    - Sets umask to 0077 before creating disk images (Closes: #548909)
    - Makes sure, MAKEDEV is found in either /dev/ or /sbin/
      (Closes: #502798, #515228)
    - Changed rinse path to /usr/sbin/. (Closes: #511211)
    - Doesn't delete configuration file if it already exists when
      xen-create-image is run. (Closes: #520177)
    - Doesn't write the FQDN into /etc/hostname (Closes: #492583)
    - Dereferences pointers before hashing them to generate a MAC
      address. (Closes: #547265)
    - Calls pwconv and grpconv inside chroot when installing Fedora
      (Closes: #499476)
    - Fixed typo in /usr/lib/xen-tools/*.d/75-fixup-securetty
      (Closes: #503339)
    - Makes better decisions about when to enable Debian security updates
      in the created DomU (LP: #309750)
    - Installs dhclient for CentOS and Fedora if DHCP networking is
      requested (LP: #241446)
    - Fixes some bashisms (Closes: #530226)
      * [^y] → [!y] (Thanks to Mathieu Parent!)
      * kill -HUP → kill -s HUP (found by checkbashism)
      * ${parm/?/pat[/str]} → echo | sed
      * echo -e → printf
      * read → read dummy
    - xt-install-image now exits with return value 127 instead of 0 to
      indicate errors on running the command given in --install-method.
      (Closes: #534290)
    - The debootstrap command now also can be configured on the
      commandline with --debootstrap-cmd in xen-create-image and
      xt-install-image (Enhances fix for #436480 which added the
      debootstrap-cmd config file option)
    - Checks for debootstrap and cdebootstrap, uses debootstrap if both
      are installed (Changed "Depends: debootstrap" to "Depends:
      debootstrap | cdebootstrap" in debian/control)
    - Added new files TODO and KNOWN_BUGS to debian/docs.
  * Removal of /etc/bash_completion.d/xm from the package since
    bash-completion ships a more elaborate version of that file. (Closes:
    #566683, #550590, LP: #538917, #484098)
  * Downgrade reiserfsprogs and xfsprogs to Suggests. (Closes: #561618,
    LP: #80233)
  * Added evms-cli to Suggests. It has been removed from Debian before
    Lenny, but it is necessary for some optional functionality of
    xen-tools. And since some Debian derived distributions (e.g. Ubuntu
    LTS and grml) still support it, it's included for the sake of
    completeness and correctness.
  * Added cfengine2 to Suggests. It is helpful to have it installed when
    using the cfengine2 role.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes necessary)
  * Bump Debhelper Compatibility to 7
    - Replace "dh_clean -k" by "dh_prep"
  * Add Vcs-* headers pointing to new upstream and packaging repository
  * Fix some Lintian warnings:
    - [debian/control]: debhelper-but-no-misc-depends
    - [debian/copyright]: copyright-without-copyright-notice
    - [debian/source/format]: missing-debian-source-format
  * Added a README.source explaining how to build xen-tools directly from
    the Git repository.
  * Overhauled package description

    - Updated manpages to avoid word-wrapping.
    - Updated --noswap option such that a LVM swap volume isn't created.
    - Reverted the usage of '--keep-debootstrap-dir' since that is a
