xen-tools (4.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.

    [ Marc Bigler ]
    + Add support for ZFS volumes. (GH #50)

    [ Yuri Sakhno ]
    + Eliminate progress reporting which is useless in logs. (GH #42)

    [ Axel Beckert ]
    + Add preliminary support for future Debian 12 Bookworm release.
    + Add support for Ubuntu releases from 17.10 Artful to 19.04 Disco.
      - Create hooks/artful with new 40-setup-networking-deb-netplan by
        Arno Bakker and Peter. (Fixes xen-tools/xen-tools#51)
      - Rename hooks/karmic/80-install-kernel to
        hooks/common/80-install-kernel-ubu and add according symlinks.
    + Change all occurrences of httpredir.debian.org to deb.debian.org
      except those for the debian-archive. The latter now point to
      archive.debian.org directly.
    + Set Ubuntu fallback suite to the latest LTS, i.e. 18.04 Bionic.
    + Drop pygrub path detection from xm.tmpl, Xen prefers a path-less
      bootloader='pygrub'.
    + Many improvements for the release-testing script.
    + Only run xen-toolstack helper script if both, xm and xl are
      present. Avoids warning about deprecated helper script.
    + distributions.conf now supports arbitrary keyring files in
      /usr/share/keyrings/. (Needed for some EoL Ubuntu releases.)

    [ Nico Boehr ]
    + Add support for LVM thin provisioning.

    [ Pietro Stäheli ]
    + Add support for option --randommac for really random MAC addresses
      upon every xen-create-image invocation. (Closes: #855703)

  [ Axel Beckert ]
  * Fix wrong bug number for #849867 in previous changelog entry.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.1.3.
    + Change Priority from extra to optional.
  * Use "$(MAKE)" instead of "make" in debian/rules.
  * debian/control: Drop "Testsuite: autopkgtest" header, no more needed.
  * Switch "activate" trigger to "activate-noawait".
  * Recommend e2fsprogs. (Closes: #887236)
  * Prefer btrfs-progs over now transitional package btrfs-tools. (Closes:
    #878910)
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 10.
    + Update versioned debhelper build-dependency accordingly.
    + Only using dh compat level 10 allows one to still build the package
      on Debian 9 Stretch without backports, on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and on
      Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with backports.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.3.0. (No changes needed.)
  * Set "Rules-Requires-Root: no".
  * Check $DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS and $DEB_BUILD_PROFILES in
    override_dh_auto_test. Fixes according lintian warning.
  * Use ubuntu-keyring instead of now transitional ubuntu-archive-keyring,
    but keep the latter as alternative to allow one to install the
    xen-tools package also on older Debian or Ubuntu releases.
  * Suggest grub-xen-host despite the proper support for it is not
    finished.
  * Add a note about "vsyscall=emulate" and older Linux distributions to
    debian/NEWS. Thanks to James Clarke and Jason Crain for the hint!
  * Add a DEP-12 debian/upstream/metadata file.

  [ Jelmer Vernooĳ ]
  * Trim trailing whitespace from debian/changelog. (GH #54)

    + Fixes reported error code in case of subcommand failure (Reported
      and fixed by Yuri Sakhno, thanks!)
    + Fixes typo found by lintian.
    + Support for Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak.
    + Preliminary support for Ubuntu 17.04 Zesty Zapus.

    + Knows about Ubuntu's "devel" alias.
    + Risen default values for RAM sizes in /etc/xen-tools/xen-tools.cfg
      to cope with risen resource consumption and availability.
      (Closes: #849867)
    + Default file system is now ext4 (instead of ext3).

      parameter. Thanks Daniel Reichelt for the bug report and patch!
      (Closes: #842609)
    + Fixes possible missing gateway in generated
      /etc/network/interfaces. (Closes: #764625)
    + Support situations where distributions (e.g. Squeeze) might be EoL,
      but its archive signing key is still not removed from the default
      keyring.
    + Workaround LVM related race condition when using --force with LVM.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 3.9.8. (No changes needed.)
  * Use NEWS.markdown as upstream changelog, don't install it as docs.
  * Switch many URLs (upstream and in packaging) to https:// and update
    URLs where they were broken or redirect somewhere else now.
  * Fix some typos in older debian/changelog and debian/NEWS items.

xen-tools (4.6.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream bugfix release

    [ Pierre Olivier ]
    + Added /usr/local/bin/pygrub to the end of the pygrub search path.

    [ nirgal ]
    + Fixed typo in initramfs comment

    [ Axel Beckert ]
    + Make t/hooks-inittab.t using its own copy of the generic /etc/inittab
      for testing instead of using the system one's. (GH#36, should fix
      autopkgtest on systems with modified /etc/inittab)
    + Fix unescaped braces (deprecated with Perl 5.22) in t/plugin-checks.t.

  * Support checking upstream GPG signature in debian/watch.

 -- Axel Beckert <abe@debian.org>  Wed, 23 Dec 2015 18:05:54 +0100

xen-tools (4.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    + Neither use $#array in boolean context nor @array = undef anymore.
  * Update Vcs-* headers to point to GitHub instead of GitLab.
  * Add debian/maintscript to remove obsolete conffile
    /etc/bash_completion.d/xen-tools properly.
  * Fix typo in previous changelog entry.

 -- Axel Beckert <abe@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Oct 2015 01:13:08 +0200

xen-tools (4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    + Fix usage of nonexistent variable in removeDebianPackage (Closes:
      #774936) Thanks Lukas Schwaighofer!
    + Change all occurrences of http.debian.net to httpredir.debian.org
    + Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx and 14.10 Utopic Unicorn now EoL.
    + Preliminary support for Debian 9 Stretch and Ubuntu 15.10 Wily
      Werewolf.
    + Installs bash completion into /usr/share/bash-completion/ (fixes
      lintian warning package-install-into-obsolete-dir)
    + Allows # within configuration file comments. (Closes: #783060;
      thanks Jean-Michel Nirgal Vourgère for the bug report and patch!)
    + Testsuite: Let modules.sh ignore the .git directory. (t/modules.t
      failed if a git commit message had a line starting with "use ".)
    + Testsuite: Optimize and clean up modules.sh.
    + Drop all occurrences of apt's --force-yes parameter. It only forces
      the installation of untrusted packages and that's unwanted. (Closes:
      #776487)
    + Support passing commandline options with --debootstrap-cmd.
    + Use -o APT::Install-Recommends=false instead of
      --no-install-recommends for backwards compatibility with older APT
      versions which don't know either (but accept any Foo=Bar parameter
      to "-o"). Allows one to install earlier Debian releases (e.g. Etch)
      with the default configuration again.
    + Use md5 as default hash method again, to be able to properly set
      passwords in older releases. Does not affect passwords changed later
      inside the DomU.
    + Split off hardcoded release code names list and default mirrors in
      xen-create-image into separate configuration file which is parsed
      before the default settings or command-line options are set.
    + Pass --yes to lvcreate only if LVM version is 2.02.99 or
      higher. Fixes regression introduced with 4.5 by the fix for #754517.
      - Add new (build-)dependency on libsort-versions-perl.
    + Report all SSH fingerprints of the created DomU, not only RSA ones.
    + Split up test suite in functionality/compatibility tests (t) and
      author/release tests (xt).
    + Make test suite support as-installed-testing
      - Mark package as autopkgtestable.
    + Multiple release workflow improvements (target release in Makefile):
      - Use TMPDIR instead of TMP for temporary directories.
      - Always run the full test suite before doing a release.
      - Use maximum compression and don't store time stamps in tar ball.
      - Make "release" target to include "orig-tar-gz" and tagging.
    + New option --keyring which is passed through to deboootstrap. Its
      default values work around bug #792729 in debootstrap.
    + Supports "unstable", "oldstable" and "oldoldstable" as distribution
      names, too. ("oldoldstable" is not yet supported by debootstrap, see
      feature request #792734 in debootstrap.)
    + New example script helpful for release testing.
    + Support VLANs with Open vSwitch (GH-2). Thanks to Félix Barbeira
      for the patch.
  * Update Vcs-* headers and documentation as Gitorious closed its doors
    in June 2015 and is now only available with static contents.
  * Recommend debian-archive-keyring (for installing Debian DomUs on
    derivatives) and ubuntu-archive-keyring (for installing Ubuntu DomUs
    on Debian).
  * Reduce the list of alternative xen-hypervisor-* packages to just
    "xen-hypervisor" which is a virtual package provided by at least all
    xen-hypervisor-* packages since Debian 6 Squeeze.
  * Recommend lvm2, it's at least required if the --lvm option is used.
  * Add an adequate as-installed test to debian/tests/control.

    + Pass "-y" option ("assume yes") to yum (Closes: #735675)
      Thanks Lionel FÉLICITÉ!
    + Drop all xend related sanity checks, they cause more havoc nowadays

    + Apply patch by Adrian C. (anrxc) to allow to override hooks in
      /usr/share/xen-tools/*.d/ with hooks in /etc/xen-tools/hooks.d/.
      Thanks! (Also add /etc/xen-tools/hooks.d/ to debian/dirs.)
    + Ignore cover_db directory in t/perl-syntax.t.
    + Update list of supported Ubuntu releases.
      - Add support for Ubuntu 14.10 Utopic Unicorn.
      - Add preliminary support for Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid Vervet.

    + Fix missing quoting in shell function "assert" in hooks/common.sh.
    + Fix initial configuration summary in cases where pygrub is used.
    + Fix corner cases where not the latest kernel would have been checked.

      Santiago Vila.
    + Add password length sanity check with fallback to default length.
    + Raise default password length from 8 to 23.
    + Flush output after each line in runCommand().
    + Makefile: Clean up coverage data in multiple targets.

    [ Santiago Vila ]
    + Fix unaligned maxmem output of xen-create-image. (Closes: #764126)
    + Fix copy & paste errors in comments in typos in roles/puppet
      (Closes: #764134)

  * Also add build-dependency on "libterm-ui-perl | perl (<< 5.17.0)" and
    "liblog-message-perl | perl (<< 5.17.0)" to avoid warnings with Perl
    5.18 and future FTBFS.
  * Mention Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr in long description.

xen-tools (4.4~rc1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release candidate
    - Also switch from cdn.debian.net to http.debian.net in xen-tools.conf
    - Do not run "passwd" via runCommand as that one captures STDOUT for
      logging. Makes --passwd usable again. Thanks to Christian Herzog for
      the bug report.
    - Loop around calling "passwd" to get a second chance to change the
      password. (Closes: #703159) Thanks to Joan <aseques@gmail.com> for a
      bug fix in this new code.
      + Add dependency on "libterm-ui-perl | perl (<< 5.17.0)"
    - Declares one more POD encoding and recode Xen::Tools::Common to
      UTF-8. Fixes FTBFS with Perl 5.18. (Finally closes: #720519)
    - Apply patch by Philipp Erbelding to fix overzealous line matching in
      xen-list-images. (Gitorious merge request #5)
    - xen-list-images now displays a unit after the memory size
    - Drop support for memory size in kilobytes in xen-create-image,
      neither xt-create-xen-config nor xm support it.
    - Refactoring: Replace all occurrences of "! -z" by "-n" in hooks and
      bash completion.
    - Handle potentially empty gateway setting properly in
      hooks/common/40-setup-networking-deb. Thanks Simone Caruso!
    - Reformat hooks/common/40-setup-networking-deb so that the result
      neither has trailing whitespace nor broken indentation.
    - Also display MAC address after the DomU has been created.
    - Preliminary support for Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr.
    - Added --maxmem flag to set a maximum value for dynamic memory
      ballooning. Thanks to Joan <aseques@gmail.com> for the patch!
    - Added fix by Patryk Ściborek againsat disableStartStopDaemon()
      aborting under some circumstances. (Closes: #725192)
    - Abort early and with proper error message if "xen-delete-image
      --test" is not used with "--dir". (Closes: #704878)
    - xen-delete-image: Exit with return code != 0 in all error cases.
    - Refactoring: xt-create-xen-config: Use s/// to strip trailing MB
      size suffixes.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes).

    - Execute END block not on --version/--help/--manual (Closes: #684346)
    - Move code for --boot feature to END block. Fixes missing SSH
      fingerprint display if --boot was used. (Closes: #679183)
    - Correctly handle aborts in END block. (Closes: #704882)
    - Use local parameter instead of global variable in unMountImage.
    - Also recognize "M" and "G" instead of "MB" and "GB" as size unit for
      --memory. (Closes: #691320) Document the recognized units.
    - Default DomUs to use the noop scheduler (Closes: #693131)
    - Overwork TLS disabling on Debian and Ubuntu
    - xen-list-images now also outputs the file name of the config file.
    - xen-list-images and xen-delete-image now understand --extension.
    - Fixes "--extension=" with empty parameter.
    - Sarge amd64 case handle properly
    - Remove CVS revisions from --version output
    - Support for Debian Jessie, Ubuntu Raring and preliminary support for
      Ubuntu Saucy (debootstrap doesn't have support for Saucy at the time
      of writing)
    - Preliminary support for xl toolstack
    - xen-create-image: Consistently use runCommand() instead of system()
    - xt-install-image: Don't bail out if only cdebootstrap is installed
      but not debootstrap (Thanks Elmar Heeb!)
    - Makefile accepts DESTDIR=…
    - Move examples from debian/examples to examples.
    - Uses File::Which exclusively (no more findBinary, no more `which`),
      added (build-) dependency on libfile-which-perl
    - Knows about module-init-tools → kmod transition in wheezy/raring.
    - Adds default mount options for ext4, identical to ext2/ext3.
    - Ships /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/xen-tools for generating Dom0
      initrds also suitable for DomU usage. Trigger update-initramfs.
    - By default install linux-image-virtual instead of linux-image-server
      on Ubuntu Intrepid and newer (Hopefully closes: #640099, LP #839492)
    - Installs a legacy grub in all pygrub based Debian/Ubuntu DomUs to be
      able to update the menu.list automatically.
    - hooks/common.sh: installDebianPackage no more installs recommends.
    - hooks/common.sh: Rename installCentOS4Package to installRPMPackage.
      Add installCentOS4Package wrapper for backward compatibility.
    - Fix filesystem tools installation in 91-install-fs-tools (which was
      broken since 4.3~rc1-1) by merging 91-install-fs-tools back into
      90-make-fstab. (Closes: #715340) Also supports RPM-based
      distributions now.
    - Fixes export of environment variables. Previously they could contain
      dashes and then were only accessible from within Perl, but not from
      within Bash.
    - Fixes creation of "ARRAY(0x…).log" named log files.
    - Makes some options (like --pygrub) negatable.
    - Uses Test::NoTabs; add according build-dependency.

      source code. Also removes the according tests from the test suite.
      → Remove no more needed build-dependency on Moose.
    - Better documents and checks requirements for the --apt_proxy
      value. (See #623443 for the corresponding apt issue.) Add (build-)
      dependency on libdata-validate-uri-perl.
    - Use Data::Validate::{Domain,IP} for IP addresses and hostname checks.
      Add corresponding (build-) dependencies on
      libdata-validate-{domain,ip}-perl.
    - Fixes broken quoting in list of required binaries
    - Declares POD encoding. Fixes FTBFS with Perl 5.18. (Closes: #720519)
  * Add debian/gbp.conf to be able to build xen-tools with
    git-buildpackage.
  * Clean up debian/rules:
    - Don't mention (generated) upstream changelog explicitly,
      dh_installchangelogs finds it by itself if it exist. That way
      building out of a freshly clone git repository does not fail due to
      a missing upstream changelog.
    - Use dh_auto_{install,clean}; use "$(MAKE)" instead of "make" where
      dh_auto_* can't help. No more explicitly call "make manpages", it's
      a depedency of "make install" in the next line anyway.
    - Finally switch to a minimal dh style debian/rules.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 9
    - Update versioned debhelper build-dependency
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4 (no changes)
  * Add dependency on ${perl:Depends} to fix dpkg-gencontrol warning.
  * Bump copyright years in debian/copyright.
  * Apply wrap-and-sort.

xen-tools (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Remove most Mercurial traces
  * Fixes FTBFS due to testsuite failures (Closes: #676681)
    - Disable tests of not yet used Xen::Tools. Fixes FTBFS in test suite
      due to not satisifed Moose dependency in Xen::Tools::Log.
    - Added build-dependencies on libmoose-perl, git, and
      libtest-pod-coverage-perl for t/perl-syntax.t, t/gitignore.t, and
      t/pod-coverage.t.
    - Skip t/hook-inittab.t if /etc/inittab is not present on the build
      host. Fixes FTBFS on Ubuntu.
  * Switch to source format to "3.0 (quilt)"

  [Axel Beckert]

      cdn.debian.net, see http://wiki.debian.org/DebianGeoMirror for
      details.
    - Uses the same 15-disable-hwclock hook for Debian as for Ubuntu DomUs

      STDOUT. (Closes: #513126)
    - Adds btrfs support.

  * New maintainer and upstream authors
  * Reintroduction into Debian Unstable (Closes: #566714)
  * New upstream beta version
    - Needs dependency on libfile-slurp-perl
    - Supports for more recent versions of Fedora, Ubuntu and Debian
      (Closes: #499477)
    - Supports pygrub. (Added "Suggests: xen-utils" to debian/control)
    - Uses hvc0 and xvda devices by default
    - Sets umask to 0077 before creating disk images (Closes: #548909)
    - Makes sure, MAKEDEV is found in either /dev/ or /sbin/
      (Closes: #502798, #515228)
    - Changed rinse path to /usr/sbin/. (Closes: #511211)
    - Doesn't delete configuration file if it already exists when
      xen-create-image is run. (Closes: #520177)
    - Doesn't write the FQDN into /etc/hostname (Closes: #492583)
    - Dereferences pointers before hashing them to generate a MAC
      address. (Closes: #547265)
    - Calls pwconv and grpconv inside chroot when installing Fedora
      (Closes: #499476)
    - Fixed typo in /usr/lib/xen-tools/*.d/75-fixup-securetty
      (Closes: #503339)
    - Makes better decisions about when to enable Debian security updates
      in the created DomU (LP: #309750)
    - Installs dhclient for CentOS and Fedora if DHCP networking is
      requested (LP: #241446)
    - Fixes some bashisms (Closes: #530226)
      * [^y] → [!y] (Thanks to Mathieu Parent!)
      * kill -HUP → kill -s HUP (found by checkbashism)
      * ${parm/?/pat[/str]} → echo | sed
      * echo -e → printf
      * read → read dummy
    - xt-install-image now exits with return value 127 instead of 0 to
      indicate errors on running the command given in --install-method.
      (Closes: #534290)
    - The debootstrap command now also can be configured on the
      commandline with --debootstrap-cmd in xen-create-image and
      xt-install-image (Enhances fix for #436480 which added the
      debootstrap-cmd config file option)
    - Checks for debootstrap and cdebootstrap, uses debootstrap if both
      are installed (Changed "Depends: debootstrap" to "Depends:
      debootstrap | cdebootstrap" in debian/control)
    - Added new files TODO and KNOWN_BUGS to debian/docs.
  * Removal of /etc/bash_completion.d/xm from the package since

    #566683, #550590, LP: #538917, #484098)
  * Downgrade reiserfsprogs and xfsprogs to Suggests. (Closes: #561618,
    LP: #80233)
  * Added evms-cli to Suggests. It has been removed from Debian before
    Lenny, but it is necessary for some optional functionality of
    xen-tools. And since some Debian derived distributions (e.g. Ubuntu
    LTS and grml) still support it, it's included for the sake of
    completeness and correctness.
  * Added cfengine2 to Suggests. It is helpful to have it installed when
    using the cfengine2 role.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes necessary)
  * Bump Debhelper Compatibility to 7
    - Replace "dh_clean -k" by "dh_prep"
  * Add Vcs-* headers pointing to new upstream and packaging repository
  * Fix some Lintian warnings:
    - [debian/control]: debhelper-but-no-misc-depends
    - [debian/copyright]: copyright-without-copyright-notice
    - [debian/source/format]: missing-debian-source-format
  * Added a README.source explaining how to build xen-tools directly from
    the Git repository.
  * Overhauled package description
